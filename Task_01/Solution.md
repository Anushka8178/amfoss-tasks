First, I began by following the instructions mentioned in Steps.md and installed gh, cloned the repository using git clone https://github.com/KshitijThareja/TerminalWizard.git.

#First Challenge 

After entering the maze, for the first challenge, I found the value of x, that is, 6 and by solving the problem given in Readme.md file(y is the number you get by differentiating (x²-7x) w.r.t 'x'), i found the value of y to be 5. Therefore, the spell was present in Spell_05.The word prsent in the file was 'Impedimenta', on executing the corresponding Python Code, the secret code obtained was 'aHR0cHM6Ly9naX'.The command used for it was python3 Impedimenta.py.

#Second Challenge 
For this challenge, the element is germanium with atomic no.32, thus, the value of y is 2 and x is 3. Therefore, the required file is Spell-03 under folder 02. The word present in it is "stupefy".On executing the corresponding python code, the secret code obtained is "RodWIuY29tL1RoZ". The command used for it was python3 Stupefy.py.

#Third Challenge 
For this challenge,the spell that I found, using the clues, was Riddikulus which was located in the "defenseAgainstTheDarkArts" branch. The secret code obtained on executing the corresponding python script was "Uh1bnRzbWFuNC9U".
To be present in the defenseAgainstTheDarkArts branch, I used git checkout defenseAgainstTheDarkArts command(since, that is the subject taught by Professor Lupin at Hogwarts). Then i used the cd spellbooks command followed by ls to shows the contents of the directory. python3 Spell_Riddikulus.py, on executing it the code is obtained.

#Fourth Challenge 
For this challenge, I initially had some trouble finding the commit logs, but was eventually able to find it using the git log command. The value of x, number of horcruxes made by Voldemort is 7 and value of y, the number that has same number of alphabets as the number is 4. The the final code was found in path07/Spell_04 of thegraveyard, that is, "aGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs" Thus, the final code after concentating all the codes is "aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1RoZUh1bnRzbWFuNC9UaGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs". On decoding the above, the link obtained is https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell.

Finally, I executed the final python script mentioned, that is, TheOneThatEndsItAll.py using the python3 TheOneThatEndsItAll.py command.
