# First Challenge </br>
After entering the maze, for the first challenge, I found the value of x, that is, 6 and by solving the problem given in Readme.md file(y is the number you get by differentiating (x²-7x) 
w.r.t 'x'), i found the value of y to be 5. Therefore, the spell was present in Spell_05.The word prsent in the file was 'Impedimenta', on executing the corresponding Python Code, the 
secret code obtained was 'aHR0cHM6Ly9naX'. 

# Second Challenge </br>
For this challenge, the element is germanium with atomic no.32, thus, the value of y is 2 and x is 3. Therefore, the required file is Spell-03 under folder 02. The word present in it 
is "stupefy".On executing the corresponding python code, the secret code obtained is "RodWIuY29tL1RoZ". 

# Third Challenge </br>
For this challenge,the spell that I found, using the clues, was Riddikulus which was located in the "defenseAgainstTheDarkArts" branch. The secret code obtained on executing the corresponding 
python script was "Uh1bnRzbWFuNC9U".

# Fourth Challenge </br>
For this challenge, I initially had some trouble finding the commit logs, but was eventually able to find it. The value of x, number of horcruxes made by Voldemort is 7 and value of y, the number
that has same number of alphabets as the number is 4. The the final code was found in path07/Spell_04 of thegraveyard, that is, "aGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs" 
Thus, the final code after concentating all the codes is "aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1RoZUh1bnRzbWFuNC9UaGVGaW5hbFNwZWxs". On decoding the above, the link obtained is https://github.com/TheHuntsman4/TheFinalSpell.

Finally, I executed the final python script mentioned, that is, TheOneThatEndsItAll.py and completed the task.
