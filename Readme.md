# **DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?** <br>
In the process, I did stumble upon few tasks which were pretty tough but the support and guidance by our mentors proved to be really helpful. The whole process was a great 
learning experience for me and I tried out various things for the first time, like competitive programming, creating a webpage. I belive that, even tough it was frustrating 
to not being able to do some tasks, but with the timely support it was a good experience.
