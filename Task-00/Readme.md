This was my first time working on ubuntu, and it was a pretty new experience working on the terminal. It did some time for me to get accustomed to the new interface. 
As for the installation, I did face some difficulties in the partitioning and space allocation, but nevertheless, was able to install it.Overall, it was a good experience working on ubuntu.
